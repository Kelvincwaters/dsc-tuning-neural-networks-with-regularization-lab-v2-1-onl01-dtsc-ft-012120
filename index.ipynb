    "# Tuning Neural Networks with Regularization - Lab \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll use a train-test partition as well as a validation set to get better insights about how to tune neural networks using regularization techniques. You'll start by repeating the process from the last section: importing the data and performing preprocessing including one-hot encoding. From there, you'll define and compile the model like before. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply early stopping criteria with a neural network \n",
    "- Apply L1, L2, and dropout regularization on a neural network  \n",
    "- Examine the effects of training with more data on a neural network  \n",

    "Did you notice an interesting pattern here? Although the training accuracy keeps increasing when going through more epochs, and the training loss keeps decreasing, the validation accuracy and loss don't necessarily do the same. After a certain point, validation accuracy keeps swinging, which means that you're probably **overfitting** the model to the training data when you train for many epochs past a certain dropoff point. Let's tackle this now. You will now specify an early stopping point when training your model. \n",
